# case-study-HOMICIDES-AND-THEIR-RELATION-TO-LITERACY-RATES

Intentional homicides are estimates of unlawful homicides purposely inflicted as a result of domestic disputes, interpersonal violence, violent conflicts over land resources, intergang violence over turf or control, and predatory violence and killing by armed groups.

There has been a great deal of empirical research on the relationship between education and crime. In states with higher levels of education, crime rates are lower than those in the rest of the country. College enrollment rates in states with higher rates of college completion lead to lower violent crime rates.

Democracy and peace are promoted by literacy. Citizens who are literate are more likely to follow local politics and be informed about the issues that matter to them. Moreover, they are more likely to vote and to participate in local government in other ways. It is closely related to illiteracy to commit crime. According to the Department of Justice, “academic failure is linked to delinquency, violence, and crime.”

Simple linear regression:

In statistics, simple linear regression is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable. That is, it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variable. The adjective simple refers to the fact that the outcome variable is related to a single predictor.

This case study predicts that if the literacy rate is  30% , the murder count per million would be around 33,and proves that murder count decreases if the literacy rates increase.

In conclusion, concentrating on educating the future generations of state will effectively help control the crimes.
